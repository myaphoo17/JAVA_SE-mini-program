# JAVA_SE-mini-projects

I am pleased to share my journey of learning Java, which began in May 2022. 
As part of my learning process, 
I've created a small Java mini-projects that showcases some of the foundational concepts I've grasped so far. 
This README serves as a brief overview of my program and what I've learned along the way.
It focuses on fundamental concepts like variables, data types, conditional statements, loops, and user input.
